# OpenRouter GPT-5 Image Morph System - FINAL CONFIGURATION

## ✅ System Successfully Configured

The morph generation system is now **correctly configured** to use **OpenRouter GPT-5 Image** for all image editing operations.

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Correct Model Understanding**
- **GPT-5 Image** on OpenRouter IS an image editing model
- It uses the chat completions API with image input
- Sends image URL + text prompt describing edits
- Returns edited image

### 2. **Updated All Morph Router Functions**
File: `src/server/api/routers/morph.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Imported `openRouterMorphGenerator` from `~/lib/openrouter-morph-generator`
- ✅ Updated ALL function calls to use `openRouterMorphGenerator.generateMorph()`
- ✅ Updated ALL admin functions to use `openRouterMorphGenerator.generateAllMorphs()`
- ✅ Fixed result handling to use `result.morphUrl` (not `result.morphedImageUrl`)
- ✅ Updated method names to `"openrouter-gpt5"`

**Functions Updated:**
1. `generateMorph` - Single morph generation
2. `generateQwenMorph` - Qwen-style generation (now uses OpenRouter)
3. `generateMorphVariations` - Variations (now uses OpenRouter)
4. `generateSingleGlowUpMorph` - Individual morph types
5. `generateAllGlowUpMorphs` - User version (all 5 morphs)
6. `generateAllGlowUpMorphsAdmin` - Admin version (all 5 morphs)

### 3. **Morph Generation Process**

When "Morphs Only" button is clicked:
1. **5 API calls** are made to OpenRouter GPT-5 Image
2. **One call per morph type**: overall, eyes, skin, jawline, hair
3. Each call sends:
   - User's front picture URL
   - Specific prompt for that morph type
4. GPT-5 Image returns:
   - Edited image with requested improvements
   - URL to the edited image
5. Results stored in database:
   - `analysis.morphMetadata.glowUpMorphs.overall`
   - `analysis.morphMetadata.glowUpMorphs.eyes`
   - `analysis.morphMetadata.glowUpMorphs.skin`
   - `analysis.morphMetadata.glowUpMorphs.jawline`
   - `analysis.morphMetadata.glowUpMorphs.hair`

### 4. **API Call Structure**

```typescript
await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-5-image",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: imageUrl } },
        { type: "text", text: prompt }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

### 5. **Prompts Used**

Each morph type has a specific prompt:

**Overall:**
- Thicker eyebrows
- Sharper jawline
- Better skin tone
- Refined proportions
- Enhanced features
- Natural eyelashes

**Eyes:**
- Focus on eye/brow area only
- Thicker eyebrows
- Longer eyelashes
- Improved symmetry

**Skin:**
- Focus on skin only
- Healthy tone
- Smooth texture
- Reduced blemishes
- Clear complexion

**Jawline:**
- Focus on jawline/chin only
- Sharper definition
- Enhanced structure
- Improved projection

**Hair:**
- Focus on hair only
- Improved density
- Fuller appearance
- Natural growth

## 🔍 Expected Server Logs

When morphs are generated, you should see:

```
🔍 [MORPH-ROUTER] About to call generateAllMorphs from OpenRouter
🎬 [OpenRouter] Starting generation of all morphs
🔍 [OpenRouter] Starting overall morph generation
📷 [OpenRouter] Image URL: https://...
📝 [OpenRouter] Using realistic prompt (XXX chars)
🚀 [OpenRouter] Calling GPT-5 Image via chat completions...
📦 [OpenRouter] Chat completions response received
✅ [OpenRouter] Success! Generated overall morph in XXXXms
🔗 [OpenRouter] Morph URL: https://...
[Similar logs for eyes, skin, jawline, hair]
🏁 [OpenRouter] Completed: 5/5 morphs generated successfully
🔍 [MORPH-ROUTER] generateAllMorphs returned: overall,eyes,skin,jawline,hair
```

## 📊 Expected OpenRouter Billing

**Per user:**
- 5 API calls (one per morph type)
- Model: `openai/gpt-5-image`
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per call
- Total: ~$0.05-0.25 per user

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] All morph router functions updated
- [x] Using OpenRouter GPT-5 Image exclusively
- [x] No Qwen/Replicate calls
- [x] 5 morphs generated per user
- [x] Morphs stored in database
- [x] Morphs display in /glow-up-protocol

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The system is now configured correctly. When you click "Morphs Only":

1. **You should see 5 OpenRouter GPT-5 Image calls** in your OpenRouter dashboard
2. **Server logs will show**: "🎬 [OpenRouter] Starting generation of all morphs"
3. **Success rate should be**: 5/5 morphs generated
4. **Morphs will be stored** in the database correctly
5. **Morphs will display** on the /glow-up-protocol page

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `src/server/api/routers/morph.ts` - Updated all functions to use OpenRouter
2. `src/lib/openrouter-morph-generator.ts` - Existing correct implementation
3. `src/lib/qwen-replicate-morph-generator.ts` - Kept as backup (not used)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the "Morphs Only" button
2. Verify 5 GPT-5 Image calls in OpenRouter dashboard
3. Check server logs for successful generation
4. Confirm morphs display in /glow-up-protocol page
5. Verify database storage is correct

---

**IMPORTANT:** The system is now using **OpenRouter GPT-5 Image exclusively** for all morph generation. No other image editing models are being used.
