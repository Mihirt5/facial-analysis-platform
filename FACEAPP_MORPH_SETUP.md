## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **"Morph looks the same as original"**
- The model is working but being conservative
- Try increasing enhancement level to "enhanced"
- Check that your Replicate API key is valid
- Ensure the model is processing (check server logs)

### **"Failed to generate morph"**
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Replicate API key in `.env`
- Ensure you have credits in your Replicate account
- Try again (temporary API issues can occur)

### **"Slider not working"**
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Works best on modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## 📊 Database Schema

The `analysis` table stores:
```typescript
morphUrl: string // URL of enhanced photo
morphMetadata: {
  enhancementParams: {...}
  processingTime: number
  confidence: number
  prompt: string
  generatedAt: Date
  method: "faceapp-style-instantid"
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Multiple variations**: Generate 3 levels at once
2. **Custom enhancements**: Let users adjust specific features
3. **Side-by-side view**: Alternative to slider
4. **Social sharing**: Share transformations
5. **History**: Save multiple morph versions
