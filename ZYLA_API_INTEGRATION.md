# Zyla Skin Face Data Analyzer API Integration

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This document describes the Zyla API integration that has been implemented for skin analysis functionality.

---

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. **Zyla API Service** - `src/lib/zyla-skin-analyzer.ts`
Core service that communicates with the Zyla API:
- `analyzeSkinWithZyla()` - Main function to analyze skin from image URL
- Structured response types for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Transforms Zyla API response into structured results
- Calculates overall skin health score

**Features Analyzed:**
- Acne & Blemishes (severity, affected areas, coverage percentage)
- Wrinkles (severity, types, locations)
- Pores (visibility, size)
- Skin Texture (smoothness, roughness)
- Hydration Levels (moisture, dry areas)
- Pigmentation (evenness, dark spots)
- Redness & Sensitivity

### 2. **API Route** - `src/app/api/zyla-analyze/route.ts`
Next.js API endpoint that handles analysis requests:
- POST endpoint at `/api/zyla-analyze`
- Validates image URL format
- Calls Zyla service
- Returns structured JSON response
- Error handling with detailed messages

### 3. **Test Page** - `src/app/zyla-test/page.tsx`
Beautiful test interface to try the integration:
- Image upload with drag & drop support
- Real-time analysis with loading states
- Overall skin health score (0-100)
- Detailed breakdown by category
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Responsive mobile-friendly design

### 4. **Environment Configuration** - `src/env.js`
Added `ZYLA_API_KEY` to the environment schema with proper validation.

---

## üîë Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Zyla API Key

1. Go to [Zyla Labs](https://zylalabs.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to the Skin Face Data Analyzer API page
4. Subscribe to a plan (they offer a 7-day free trial)
5. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

Add the following line to your `.env` or `.env.local` file:

```bash
ZYLA_API_KEY=your_zyla_api_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `your_zyla_api_key_here` with your actual Zyla API key.

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

After adding the environment variable, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Access the Test Page

Navigate to: **`http://localhost:3000/zyla-test`**

### How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop a facial image
   - Supports JPG, PNG formats

2. **Analyze**
   - Click the "Analyze Skin" button
   - Wait 2-5 seconds for analysis (the API call will process)

3. **View Results**
   - Overall skin health score (0-100)
   - Detailed metrics with severity indicators
   - Category-wise summary
   - Affected areas for each issue

---

## üé® Features

### Visual Indicators

- **Excellent** - Green (85+ score)
- **Good** - Blue (70-84 score)
- **Moderate** - Yellow (50-69 score)
- **Poor/Severe** - Orange/Red (below 50)

### Analysis Categories

1. **Acne & Blemishes** - Coverage percentage and severity
2. **Aging Signs** - Wrinkle types and locations
3. **Skin Texture** - Pore visibility and smoothness
4. **Hydration** - Moisture levels and dry areas
5. **Pigmentation** - Tone evenness and dark spots
6. **Sensitivity** - Redness levels

## üîß Technical Details

### API Endpoint

```
POST https://zylalabs.com/api/9339/skin+face+data+analyzer+api/16877/skin+analysis
```

### Request Format

```json
{
  "analysis_type": "comprehensive",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "focus_areas": ["acne", "wrinkles", "pores", "texture", "hydration", "pigmentation"]
}
```

### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Response Structure

The Zyla API returns comprehensive skin analysis data including:
- Severity levels for each metric
- Affected facial areas
- Percentage coverage for issues
- Heat maps and segmentation data

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Production Use

1. **Image Upload to CDN**
   - The Zyla API requires publicly accessible image URLs
   - Currently uses base64 data URLs (works for testing)
   - For production, upload images to UploadThing/S3/Cloudinary first
   - Then pass the public URL to the API

2. **Replace Existing Analysis**
   - To use Zyla instead of Claude/OpenRouter, update the analysis flow
   - Replace calls in `src/lib/openrouter-analysis-generator.ts`
   - Or integrate both for comprehensive analysis

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add retry logic for failed API calls
   - Handle rate limiting (check Zyla's limits)
   - Display user-friendly error messages

4. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor API usage
   - Implement caching for repeated analyses
   - Consider batch processing for multiple images

## üìä Comparison: Zyla vs Claude/OpenRouter

### Zyla Strengths
- ‚úÖ Specialized in skin analysis
- ‚úÖ Quantitative metrics (percentages, scores)
- ‚úÖ Heat maps and segmentation
- ‚úÖ Faster response times
- ‚úÖ Lower cost per analysis

### Claude/OpenRouter Strengths
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive facial structure analysis
- ‚úÖ Natural language descriptions
- ‚úÖ Broader feature coverage (jaw, nose, eyes, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Contextual understanding

### Recommendation
Consider using **both**:
- **Zyla** for skin health metrics
- **MediaPipe** for facial landmarks and structure
- Combine for complete analysis

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "ZYLA_API_KEY is not configured"
- Ensure you added the key to your `.env` file
- Restart the dev server after adding
- Check for typos in the variable name

### "Invalid image URL format"
- Zyla requires valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs or base64 data URLs
- For production, upload images to a CDN first

### "No skin analysis data returned" or "Unexpected API response structure"
- **Check the console logs**: The code now logs the raw API response
- Look for `üì¶ Raw API Response:` in your terminal/console
- This will show you exactly what the Zyla API is returning
- The API documentation doesn't provide example responses, so we need to inspect the actual data
- Common causes:
  - API key is invalid or expired
  - Image URL is not accessible
  - Image doesn't contain a detectable face
  - API structure has changed
  - Account has no credits remaining

### Debugging Unknown API Responses
When you see this error, follow these steps:

1. **Check your terminal/console** for these log lines:
   ```
   üì¶ Raw API Response: { ... }
   üîç Extracted skin data: { ... }
   ```

2. **Copy the raw response** and examine its structure

3. **If it's an error from Zyla**, it might look like:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Invalid API key",
     "message": "Authentication failed"
   }
   ```

4. **If it's successful but different structure**, update the code in `src/lib/zyla-skin-analyzer.ts` to match the actual response format

5. **Share the response structure** with your team or check Zyla's updated documentation

### Rate Limiting
- Check your Zyla plan limits
- Implement request throttling
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### API Returns Empty or Null
- Verify the image is a valid facial photo (frontal view works best)
- Try with a different image URL
- Check if the Zyla API is experiencing downtime
- Contact Zyla support if the issue persists
