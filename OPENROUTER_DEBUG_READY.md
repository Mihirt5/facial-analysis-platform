# OpenRouter GPT-5 Image - Debug Ready

## ✅ System Configuration Complete

The morph system is now configured to use **OpenRouter GPT-5 Image** with **comprehensive response logging** to identify the exact response format.

## 🔍 What Was Done

### 1. Reverted to OpenRouter
- ✅ All imports updated to use `openRouterMorphGenerator`
- ✅ All function calls updated to use OpenRouter methods
- ✅ Result property names fixed (`morphUrl` not `morphedImageUrl`)

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging

File: `src/lib/openrouter-morph-generator.ts` (lines 200-263)

**New logging added:**
- Full response structure (JSON.stringify)
- Message object details
- Content type (string vs array)
- Content value (full JSON)
- 4 different extraction methods with individual logging
- Detailed error logging showing what content was

### 3. Multiple Extraction Methods

The system now tries 4 different ways to extract the image:

**Method 1:** String content (markdown or plain URL)
**Method 2:** Array content with image_url type
**Method 3:** Direct URL string
**Method 4:** Base64 data URL (data:image/...)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Test the System

1. Click "Morphs Only" button in `/review/orders`
2. Check server terminal logs for detailed output
3. Look for these key log lines:

```
🔍 [OpenRouter] Full response structure: { ... }
🔍 [OpenRouter] Message object: { ... }
🔍 [OpenRouter] Content type: string/object/array
🔍 [OpenRouter] Content value: ...
🔍 [OpenRouter] Attempting URL extraction...
```

### Expected Outcomes

**If extraction works:**
```
✅ [OpenRouter] Found URL in [method]: https://...
✅ [OpenRouter] Success! Generated [type] morph in XXXms
```

**If extraction fails:**
```
❌ [OpenRouter] Could not extract morph URL from response
❌ [OpenRouter] Content was: [actual content]
```

## 📊 What to Look For

The detailed logs will show us:

1. **Full response structure** - See every field in the response
2. **Content location** - Where is the image data actually located?
3. **Content format** - Is it a URL, base64, or something else?
4. **Extraction failure** - Why isn't the current logic working?

## 🎯 Once We See the Logs

Based on what we see in the logs, we'll be able to:

1. **Identify the exact field** where GPT-5 Image puts the generated image
2. **Update extraction logic** to handle that specific format
3. **Fix the parsing** to extract the URL correctly
4. **Achieve 5/5 success rate** with all morphs working

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/server/api/routers/morph.ts`**
   - All functions use `openRouterMorphGenerator`
   - All results use `result.morphUrl`
   - Method: `"openrouter-gpt5"`

2. **`src/lib/openrouter-morph-generator.ts`**
   - Added extensive logging (lines 200-263)
   - 4 different extraction methods
   - Detailed error reporting

## 🎯 Ready for Testing

**Please test the "Morphs Only" button now!**

The server logs will show us:
- ✅ Exact GPT-5 Image response format
- ✅ Where the image is in the response
- ✅ Why extraction is failing
- ✅ How to fix it

Once you share the logs, I'll immediately fix the extraction logic and get the system working! 🚀
