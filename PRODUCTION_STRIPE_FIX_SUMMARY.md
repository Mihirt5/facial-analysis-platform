# Production Stripe Subscription Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® **Problem Identified**
Users in production were getting `500 Internal Server Error` when trying to subscribe because they had invalid Stripe customer IDs (`cus_St0NzJT01tRYdZ`) cached in their sessions.

## ‚úÖ **Complete Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Client-Side Error Handling** (Already Deployed)
- **File**: `/src/app/payment/_components/payment-buttons.tsx`
- **Function**: Detects Stripe errors (`No such customer`, `resource_missing`)
- **Action**: Automatically clears session and redirects to onboarding

### 2. **Server-Side Data Clearing** (Just Deployed)
- **New File**: `/src/server/utils/clear-stripe-data-plugin.ts`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/subscription/clear-stripe-data`
- **Function**: Clears invalid Stripe customer IDs from database
- **Integration**: Added to better-auth configuration

### 3. **Enhanced Error Recovery** (Just Deployed)
- **Process**: When Stripe error occurs:
  1. Client detects invalid customer ID error
  2. Calls server endpoint to clear database record
  3. Signs out user to clear session cache
  4. Redirects to onboarding for fresh session
  5. User can now subscribe normally

## üîß **How It Works**

### For Users Stuck with Invalid Customer IDs:
1. **User clicks subscribe** ‚Üí Gets 500 error
2. **Error handler triggers** ‚Üí Detects "No such customer" error
3. **Server clears data** ‚Üí Removes invalid customer ID from database
4. **Session cleared** ‚Üí User signed out to clear cached session
5. **Fresh start** ‚Üí Redirected to onboarding for clean session
6. **Success** ‚Üí User can now subscribe normally

### For New Users:
- No issues - they get fresh Stripe customer IDs
- Normal subscription flow works perfectly

3. `src/server/utils/auth.ts` - Added plugin to auth configuration

### API Endpoints:

### Error Patterns Handled:
- `No such customer: 'cus_St0NzJT01tRYdZ'`
- `resource_missing`
