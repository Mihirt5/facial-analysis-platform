# Persistent Authentication Redirect Loop - Complete Fix

## Problem Description

**Issue**: Users getting stuck in redirect loops, being sent back to `/intake` even after completing onboarding, with console logs showing:
```
Desktop intake: Still loading user status data...
```

**Duration**: This has been a persistent issue for years.

**Root Cause**: TRPC queries were configured with `retry: false` and `refetchOnMount: false`, causing them to fail silently and never recover.

## Technical Analysis

### The Failing Flow

1. **User completes onboarding** and gets authenticated
2. **User clicks a button** that should take them to `/analysis` or `/payment`
3. **App redirects to `/intake`** instead (incorrectly)
4. **Desktop intake client loads** and tries to check user status
5. **TRPC queries fail** due to ByteString errors (now fixed) or other issues
6. **Queries never retry** because `retry: false` is set
7. **Queries never refetch** because `refetchOnMount: false` is set
8. **User gets stuck** with "Still loading user status data..." forever

### The Problematic Configuration

```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC - This was causing the issue
const { data: userAnalyses } = api.analysis.getUserAnalyses.useQuery(undefined, {
  enabled: !isSessionLoading && !!session?.user,
  retry: false,                    // ❌ Never retries on failure
  refetchOnMount: false,           // ❌ Never refetches when component mounts
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,     // ❌ Never refetches on window focus
});
```

### Why This Configuration Was Problematic

1. **`retry: false`**: If the initial query fails (due to ByteString errors, network issues, etc.), it never tries again
2. **`refetchOnMount: false`**: When the user navigates to the page, it doesn't fetch fresh data
3. **No error handling**: Failed queries just silently fail, leaving data as `undefined`
4. **Redirect logic breaks**: The app can't determine user status, so it defaults to showing the intake form

## Complete Solution

### 1. Fixed Query Configuration

**Before**:
```typescript
const { data: userAnalyses } = api.analysis.getUserAnalyses.useQuery(undefined, {
  enabled: !isSessionLoading && !!session?.user,
  retry: false,
  refetchOnMount: false,
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const { data: userAnalyses, error: analysesError } = api.analysis.getUserAnalyses.useQuery(undefined, {
  enabled: !isSessionLoading && !!session?.user,
  retry: 2, // ✅ Allow retries for failed requests
  refetchOnMount: true, // ✅ Refetch when component mounts
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // ✅ Don't refetch on window focus to avoid spam
});
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Error Handling

**Before**:
```typescript
if (!subscriptionStatus || userAnalyses === undefined) {
  console.log("Desktop intake: Still loading user status data...");
  return;
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Check if still loading
if (isLoadingIntake || isLoadingSubscription || isLoadingAnalyses) {
  console.log("Desktop intake: Still loading user status data...");
  return;
}

// Handle query errors - if queries failed, redirect to auth to re-establish session
if (intakeError || subscriptionError || analysesError) {
  console.error("Desktop intake: Query errors detected:", {
    intakeError: intakeError?.message,
    subscriptionError: subscriptionError?.message,
    analysesError: analysesError?.message,
  });
  
  console.log("Desktop intake: Redirecting to auth due to query errors");
  setHasRedirected(true);
  window.location.href = "/auth";
  return;
}
```

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Safety

**Before**:
```typescript
isSubscribed: subscriptionStatus.isSubscribed,
analysisCount: userAnalyses.length,
```

**After**:
```typescript
isSubscribed: subscriptionStatus?.isSubscribed,
analysisCount: userAnalyses?.length || 0,
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. Desktop Intake Client
**File**: `src/app/intake/_components/desktop-intake-client.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed query configuration for all three status queries
- ✅ Added error handling and logging
- ✅ Added fallback redirect to auth on query failures
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript safety issues

### 2. Mobile Onboarding
**File**: `src/app/mobile/onboarding/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed query configuration for all three status queries
- ✅ Added error handling and logging
- ✅ Added fallback redirect to auth on query failures

### 3. Payment Buttons
**File**: `src/app/payment/_components/payment-buttons.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed query configuration to allow refetch on mount

## Why This Fixes the Persistent Issue

### 1. **Resilient Query Behavior**
- Queries now retry on failure (up to 2 times)
- Queries refetch when components mount (fresh data)
- Failed queries are properly detected and handled

### 2. **Proper Error Recovery**
- When queries fail, users are redirected to `/auth` to re-establish their session
- This prevents infinite loading states
- Users get a clear path to recovery

### 3. **Better Debugging**
- Comprehensive error logging shows exactly what's failing
- Console logs help identify issues in production
- Error states are properly handled instead of ignored

### 4. **TypeScript Safety**
- Optional chaining prevents runtime errors
- Proper null checks ensure safe data access
- Build-time type checking catches potential issues

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Normal Flow (No Errors)
1. User completes onboarding → authenticated
2. User clicks button → redirected to correct page based on status
3. Status queries succeed → proper routing logic executes

### ✅ Error Recovery Flow
1. User completes onboarding → authenticated  
2. User clicks button → redirected to `/intake` (due to query failure)
3. Status queries fail → error detected and logged
4. User redirected to `/auth` → session re-established
5. User can proceed normally

### ✅ No More Infinite Loading
- No more "Still loading user status data..." forever
- Failed queries are detected and handled
- Users always have a path forward

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Normal Authentication Flow**
- Sign in → should redirect to correct page based on status
- Navigate between pages → should work without redirect loops

### 2. **Error Recovery**
- If queries fail → should redirect to auth instead of getting stuck
- After re-authentication → should work normally

### 3. **Console Logging**
- Check browser console for detailed error information
- Look for "Query errors detected" messages if issues occur

## Prevention

This fix prevents the issue by:

1. **Making queries resilient** - they retry and refetch as needed
2. **Handling failures gracefully** - errors are detected and users are given a recovery path
3. **Providing visibility** - comprehensive logging helps identify issues
4. **Ensuring type safety** - TypeScript catches potential runtime errors

## Related Issues Also Fixed

- **ByteString errors** (from previous fix) - headers are now sanitized
- **Database migration issues** - documented in `DATABASE_MIGRATION_FIX.md`
- **Query configuration problems** - now properly configured for reliability
