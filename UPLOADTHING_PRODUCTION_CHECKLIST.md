# Optional (for client-side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=y40hvd26ja
```

### 2. UploadThing Dashboard Configuration
- âœ… App ID: `y40hvd26ja`
- âœ… Region: `sea1` (Singapore)
- âœ… File storage: Configured
- âœ… Webhook endpoints: Configured

### 3. Next.js Configuration
- âœ… Remote patterns include UploadThing hostname
- âœ… API routes properly configured
- âœ… Middleware authentication working

### 4. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test authenticated file upload
- [ ] Test unauthenticated upload (should fail)
- [ ] Test non-subscribed user upload (should fail)
- [ ] Test file size limits (4MB max)
- [ ] Test file type restrictions (images only)
- [ ] Test multiple file uploads (should fail - max 1)

### 5. Production Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor UploadThing dashboard for usage
- [ ] Check error logs for upload failures
- [ ] Verify file storage and retrieval
- [ ] Test CDN delivery of uploaded files

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **401 Unauthorized**: User not logged in
2. **Not subscribed**: User needs active subscription
3. **File too large**: Exceeds 4MB limit
4. **Invalid file type**: Not an image
5. **Multiple files**: Only 1 file allowed per upload

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for client-side errors
2. Check server logs for authentication issues
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Test with authenticated, subscribed user
5. Check UploadThing dashboard for API errors

## ðŸ“‹ Final Verification

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] All environment variables set in production
- [ ] UploadThing dashboard shows correct configuration
- [ ] Test uploads work with authenticated, subscribed users
- [ ] Error handling works for edge cases
- [ ] File storage and retrieval works correctly
- [ ] CDN delivery is fast and reliable

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

UploadThing is production-ready when:
- âœ… Authenticated, subscribed users can upload images
- âœ… Unauthenticated users get proper error messages
- âœ… File size and type restrictions work
- âœ… Uploaded files are accessible via CDN
- âœ… Error handling is user-friendly
- âœ… Performance is acceptable (< 5s upload time)
