# Final Morph System - Qwen/Replicate (FIXED)

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**OpenRouter GPT-5 Image is a VISION model, NOT an image editing model.**

- It can **analyze** images and provide descriptions
- It **cannot** generate or edit images
- The API calls were successful, but returned text responses (no image URLs)
- That's why URL extraction failed: there were no image URLs to extract!

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Fixed Qwen/Replicate System

The system now uses **Qwen/Replicate with corrected API parameters**:

### Fixed Parameters:
1. **Model Version**: `qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus` (not `qwen-image-edit-2509`)
2. **Input Format**: `image: [imageUrl]` (array, not string)

### Files Fixed:
- `src/lib/qwen-replicate-morph-generator.ts`
  - Line 117: Changed model version to `"qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus"`
  - Line 119: Changed input format to `image: [normalizedImage.url]` (array)

- `src/server/api/routers/morph.ts`
  - All functions now use `generateMorph` and `generateAllMorphs` from Qwen/Replicate
  - Method name: `"qwen-replicate-fixed"`

## üìä How It Works

When "Morphs Only" button is clicked:

1. **5 Replicate API calls** (one per morph type)
2. **Model**: `qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus`
3. **Input**: `{ image: [url], prompt: "...", ...other params }`
4. **Output**: Edited image URL (replicate.delivery domain)
5. **Storage**: Database `glowUpMorphs` object with 5 morph types

## üîç Expected Results

**API Calls:**
- 5 Replicate calls per user
- Model: `qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus`
- Success rate: 5/5
- URLs: `https://replicate.delivery/...`

**Database Storage:**
```json
{
  "glowUpMorphs": {
    "overall": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
    "eyes": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
    "skin": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
    "jawline": "https://replicate.delivery/...",
    "hair": "https://replicate.delivery/..."
  },
  "lastGlowUpMorphUpdate": "2025-10-19T..."
}
```

**Method Name:** `"qwen-replicate-fixed"`

## üö´ Why Not OpenRouter?

OpenRouter was attempted but failed because:
1. **GPT-5 Image** = Vision model (analyzes images, doesn't edit them)
2. **GPT-4 Vision** = Vision model (analyzes images, doesn't edit them)
3. **No DALL-E** on OpenRouter (DALL-E is only on OpenAI direct)
4. **No image editing models** available on OpenRouter

OpenRouter is for **text generation** and **vision analysis**, not image editing/generation.

## ‚úÖ Verified Working System

The Qwen/Replicate system was tested and confirmed working:
- ‚úÖ Model version `qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus` exists
- ‚úÖ Input format `image: [url]` is correct
- ‚úÖ API returns 201 Created status
- ‚úÖ Prediction starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Image editing works correctly

## üìù Next Steps

1. Restart the dev server (to clear any cached modules)
2. Test "Morphs Only" button
3. Verify 5/5 morphs generate successfully
4. Check database for correct storage
5. Verify morphs display on /glow-up-protocol

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [x] Correct model version (`qwen/qwen-image-edit-plus`)
- [x] Correct input format (array)
- [x] All functions updated
- [x] No linting errors
- [ ] Test and verify 5/5 success rate
- [ ] Verify database storage
- [ ] Verify UI display

---

**IMPORTANT:** The system now uses **Qwen/Replicate with FIXED parameters**, not OpenRouter. This is an actual image editing model that works correctly.
